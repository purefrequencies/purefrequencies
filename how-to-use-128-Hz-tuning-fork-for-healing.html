    <p>Sound healing is a gentle, natural practice that uses vibration to support relaxation and balance. One of the most widely used tools is the 128 Hz tuning fork. This frequency is known for its grounding effect on the body and is often used in massage therapy, meditation, and holistic wellness routines.</p>

    <p>High-quality <a href="https://purefrequencies.com/" target="_blank">tuning forks for healing</a> are designed to produce stable, pure tones that interact smoothly with the body’s natural rhythms, helping you shift from stress into calm.</p>

    <h2>How Effective Are Tuning Forks for Healing</h2>

    <p>Tuning forks create vibration that travels through the body and nervous system. This can encourage a relaxation response, which may help reduce stress and physical tension. While they are not a replacement for medical treatment, many people use them as a supportive wellness tool.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Encourages deep relaxation</li>
      <li>May ease muscle tightness</li>
      <li>Supports mental clarity</li>
      <li>Promotes a sense of grounding</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The 128 Hz frequency is especially valued because its lower vibration resonates well with muscles and joints, making it popular in bodywork and therapeutic settings.</p>

    <h2>How to Use Tuning Forks for Healing</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Activate the Fork</h3>
    <p>Hold the stem and gently strike the prongs against a rubber activator or your palm. This creates a clean, steady vibration.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Apply to the Body</h3>
    <p>Place the base of a weighted fork on areas like the chest, shoulders, spine, or feet. These areas help conduct vibration through the body.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Use in the Energy Field</h3>
    <p>You can also hold the fork a few inches away from the body and move it slowly around areas that feel tense. Many people use this method around the head and heart space for calming effects.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Breathe Slowly</h3>
    <p>Take deep, slow breaths while listening to the tone fade. A session can last 5–15 minutes and works best when you are relaxed and present.</p>
